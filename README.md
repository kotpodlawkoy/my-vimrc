# my-vimrc
just some vimrc stuff for downloading to some target system

##About languages:
* **C#** at 28.11.2025 maden that it is essentially only for VS Code :^(. Omnisharp isn't that good as it seems, ESPECIALLY for Unity. 

### Recommended setup for Win
* **AutoHotkeyDash** with caps_lang_switch.ahk script (_you can put the shortcut to shell:startup to let the script be able to autoload after system reboot_)
* **Windows Terminal**, which is **NOT** downloaded to WindowsApps
* **PowerShell 7** as WindowsTerminal shell

### Recommended setup for Ubuntu
* Ubuntu is fine, but there is also **PowerShell 7**
